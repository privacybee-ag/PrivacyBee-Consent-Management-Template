# Privacybee Consent Manager - GTM Template

A Google Tag Manager custom template that integrates Privacybee consent management with Google Consent Mode v2. The template automatically manages GDPR-compliant cookie consent by setting default denied states and updating consent based on user choices through the Privacybee banner.

The template handles all Google Consent Mode consent types (ad_storage, analytics_storage, ad_personalization, etc.) and emits custom GTM events for advanced tracking configurations.
